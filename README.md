# event-analysis

Doing some analysis on events on Facebook

Data we hae

- Facebook Event
- API Checkins
- Twitter
- Talking to them/Feedback

Pre-event

- Understand how many people have been to our event in the past
  - Achieved by looking at the IDs and trying to match them with the IDs in the API
    - Also helps us if we need to email out something rather than post it on Facebook.

During-event

- Manage to track how many Checkins are coming in. 
- Check how many people are live-tweeting about the event. Make it easy to view people who are tweeting @TechatNYU, or #{eventname}

Post-event

- Look at RSVP's on Facebook, Checkins, and how many people were new/returning.
- Look at breakdown of who came to the event, and what events have they been to in the past.
